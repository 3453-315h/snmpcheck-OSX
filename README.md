snmpcheck-OSX
=============

Like to snmpwalk, snmpcheck allows you to enumerate the SNMP devices and places the output in a very human readable friendly format. It could be useful for penetration testing or systems monitoring. Distributed under GPL license and based on "Athena-2k" script by jshaw.
